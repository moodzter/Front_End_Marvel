======>TECHNOLOGIES USED

We used multiple technologies to build our backend application. We used express, JSON data, cors, mongoose, mongoDB Atlas, mongo, node, and extensive knowledge of git to accomplish our goal. We successfully built a fully working API which we use in our front-end application. We also used our knowledge of deploying to the web, and used heroku as our tool. We built a model on which to base our data, and built our API off of that with all 7 restful routes, utilizing full CRUD. 

Our Schema we used inside of our backend application is based off of general comicsbooks. There are the superhero names, the authors, the cover art URL, the description, the rating, and the price. We dynamically created and tested each one through postman, before eventually moving the functionality towards the front end. 

In our front end we used axios, reactJS, JS, CSS, HTML, JSX, React-bootstrap, and knowledge of javascript methods to accomplish a user friendly, fully functional application in which you can add, edit, view, and delete comic books that are displayed inside of a flexbox. Thinking of user experiences, we added a filtered drop down menu in which you can sort all the comicbooks by superhero name, with the result of only displaying the comics with the related superhero. 

Using our knowledge off React, JS, CSS, and Bootstrap we utilized components that are able to render different pages of information with user interactions such as on 'clicks' and 'hover'. Also, we utilized bootstrap to have a header which has our main functions stated in the nav bar. In there, you can view the collection, add a new comic, and see how many things are in your cart. We were also able to show different functionality of edit and show by having our data being dynamically populated inside of our home page, and then using our data that's being populated to show more specific data inside of our show more information inside of our off-canvas. 

In general, users are able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete new and existing comics, that are being stored in a cloud database, and being pulled by an API of our own creation. 

======>UNSOLVED PROBLEMS 

Our problems that were left unsolved were minor, but mostly had to do with simpler user interaction. For instance, we wanted more styling inside of our add new comic tab. Also, being able to close and toggle the pop over with two buttons, because right now you would have to click the edit comic button again, whereas having a close button in the top would be more user friendly. 

Also for a further step down the road, we would like to add more cart functionality. For instance the user can view their cart and what is inside of it. As well as the prices of each item, and the accumulated total of all prices. In the collection page, our add to cart button would add that specific comic to our cart, and notify the user of doing so. 

A factor that we would like to add as well is making the Nav bar stick to the top of the page, instead of staying at the top after you have scrolled past it.
======>USER STORIES 

Struggled with creating the dynamicness of the dropdown menu, and also showing the related comic upon clicking the superhero. Also the edit functionality was trial and error. We spent a lot of time getting the show page to render, and how to even register different pages/views with one click. Also, being able to view completely different pages upon clicking an item on the nav bar was also a struggle.
